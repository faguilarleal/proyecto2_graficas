# Lesson 3: Understanding the Main Render Loop

In this lesson, we will dive into the core of real-time graphics: the main render loop. We will break down its components and understand how each part works together to create smooth, responsive graphics applications.

## Key Definitions

    *Render Loop:* The continuous cycle that runs during the lifetime of a graphics application, responsible for updating the screen.
    *Exit Condition:* A condition that, when met, terminates the render loop and closes the application.
    *Buffer:* A block of memory used to store pixel data before it is rendered on the screen.
    *Frame Rate (FPS):* The number of frames displayed per second. Higher frame rates result in smoother motion.

## Main Parts of the Render Loop

### - Initialization:
        Set up necessary variables, buffers, and create the window.

### - Exit Condition:
        Check for conditions that signal the end of the application, such as a specific key press or window close event.

### - Listening to User Input:
        Handle user inputs like keyboard and mouse events.

### - Clearing the Buffer:
        Clear the buffer to prepare it for the new frame's pixel data.

### - Drawing Phase:
        Update the buffer with new pixel data to be rendered.

### - Update the Window:
        Send the buffer data to the window for display.

### - Calculate Frame Rate:
        Track and display the frame rate (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Initialization

    Create a buffer to store pixel data.
    Create a window using a window management library (e.g., minifb).

### 2. Exit Condition

    Continuously check if the exit condition (such as pressing the ESC key) is met to break out of the loop and close the application.

### 3. Listening to User Input

    Poll for user input (keyboard or mouse events) and handle accordingly.

### 4. Clearing the Buffer

    Reset the buffer to a default state (e.g., setting all pixels to black) before drawing the new frame.

### 5. Drawing Phase

    Populate the buffer with the new frame's pixel data. This can include drawing shapes, images, or other graphics.

### 6. Update the Window

    Render the contents of the buffer to the window, making the new frame visible on the screen.

### 7. Calculate Frame Rate

    Track the time it takes to render each frame and calculate the frames per second (FPS) to monitor performance.

This structure ensures a smooth and responsive graphics application by continuously updating and rendering frames in a loop. By understanding each part of the render loop, students will be able to create more complex and interactive graphics programs.
